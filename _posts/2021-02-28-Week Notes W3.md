## This week I have been mostly

* Reading [A Darker Domain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2573867-a-darker-domain)
* Watched a online event featuring Markus Stitz about bikepacking.  It got the dreams for the year stirring.
* Completed an online First Aid Course, an unfortunately necessary situation. I still need to complete an in person practical to complete the certificate.
* Took a trip to a shop (gasp) early on Saturday to get compost and get a part to fix a toilet.
* Sunday bike ride to Bonnyrigg
* Planted out seeds of onion, carrot, broccoli, jalapeno and salah.
