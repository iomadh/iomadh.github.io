Let's see if I can start to do this as a regular thing. 

This week I have been mostly :-

* I'm using [NodeRed](https://nodered.org/) to automate the generation of [Obsidian](obsidian.md) Notes.  So far this is limited to taking research notes from Pocket (specifically tagged) and generating links in an Obsidian file, and generating a daily note with the agenda from my Google Calendar.  
* Enjoyed the first cricket test match between India and England
* In a collaboration with Microsoft, I'm trying to create a build pipeline for our work systems in Azure DevOps
* Tuesday was a really heavy snow day and Tesco cancelled their home delivery. It was okay though, we can rebook.  Which is not so okay because all the slots are filled for the next two weeks.   G had to walk to school and then there were only a couple of kids in.  The school should have been shut for the day
* Doing an hour a day learning JavaScipt (it's about time I got into some front end development)
* Did not enjoy the 6 Nations match between Scotland and Wales.
* My first car drive for quite a while as I had to take my bike back to the shop
* Completed the Tour De Zwift on Sunday as the snow starts to melt.
* We seem to have a blocked pipe somewhere; it is probably frozen and I hope it will clear by itself as temperatures are set to rise significantly this week.
