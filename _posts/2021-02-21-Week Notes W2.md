This week I have been mostly :-

* Watching another excellent episode of WandaVision.  These episodes are too short for such good cliffhangers.
* Didn't enjoy the second test match so much.
* The snow cleared and I went outside on my bike twice including my longest ride for four months, down to Biggar and Tinto.
* G got me a puzzle quiz for Valentine's Day which we did togther on Monday. 
* Had a migraine Tuesday. This is a rare event now so I've stopped tracking when I get them.  In my 30s I could get 3 or 4 a week, now it's more like 3 or 4 a year.
* Wanted to plant my seeds into the trays but I'd been sent the wrong type of compost.  Will have to go to an actual shop and buy some.
